Here are few things about **you**, the participants of the course, based on the questionnaire that many of you filled.

Programming background
----------------------

- You have been programming 4.5 years (median)

    - Some of you have just started whereas some of you have programmed for 30 years

- Many of you have experience either in Python (58 %) or R (50 %).

    - You have experience also from many other languages such as Java, C, Javascript, Matlab, Perl, Fortran, Bash, Android

- Most of you understand the basics of programming well. Good!

GIS background
--------------

- You are fairly experienced in doing GIS! Median: 5 years (between 0-30 years), your average experience rating was 3/5.

- Most of you have experience in Quantum GIS (90 %) and ArcGIS (80 %)

    - You have also experience from many other GIS softwares / frameworks such as MapInfo, R, GRASS, PostGIS, SAGA, Geoserver, GDAL, Whitebox

What would you like to learn?
-----------------------------

**What will be covered**

- Basics of doing GIS with Python without using desktop softwares such as ArcGIS.

    - **Good!** That is exactly what we are here for! ðŸ˜Ž

- Raster processing in Python

   - The basics of raster processing in Python will be introduced but not any remote sensing stuff

- How to use CSC computing resources?

   - There is a short introduction included to the topic

**What cannot be covered**

- Interfacing GDAL & GRASS externally with Python

   - Won't be covered but there are materials available explaining `how to use GDAL with Python <https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016/Lesson7-overview.html>`__.

- OOP GIS programming

    - Conducting GIS with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) cannot be covered in the course (would require that everyone understands the concepts of OOP).

- How to use Python in web service backends?

    - This is out of the scope of this course but I would recommend checking e.g. `Flask (web framework) <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`__ with `GeoAlchemy2 <https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ or `Psycopg2 <http://initd.org/psycopg/>`__ for communicating between PostgreSQL / PostGIS database and the application, or as an alternative you can check `Geodjango <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/gis/>`__ geographic Web framework based on `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__.
