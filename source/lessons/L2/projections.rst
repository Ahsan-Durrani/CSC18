Map projections
===============

Coordinate reference systems (CRS) are important because the geometric shapes in a GeoDataFrame are simply a
collection of coordinates in an arbitrary space. A CRS tells Python how those coordinates related to places on
the Earth. A map projection (or a projected coordinate system) is a systematic transformation of the latitudes and
longitudes into a plain surface where units are quite commonly represented as meters (instead of decimal degrees).

As map projections of gis-layers are fairly often defined differently (i.e. they do not match), it is a
common procedure to redefine the map projections to be identical in both
layers. It is important that the layers have the same projection as it
makes it possible to analyze the spatial relationships between layer,
such as conduct the Point in Polygon spatial query.

Luckily, defining and changing projections is easy in Geopandas. In this tutorial we will see how to retrieve the
coordinate reference system information from the data, and how to change it. We will re-project a data file from
WGS84 (lat, lon coordinates) into a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection which is the `recommended projection for
Europe <http://mapref.org/LinkedDocuments/MapProjectionsForEurope-EUR-20120.pdf>`__ by European Commission.

.. note::

   Choosing an appropriate projection for your map is not always straightforward because it depends on what you actually want
   to represent with your map, and what is the spatial scale of your data. In fact, there does not exist a "perfect projection"
   since each one of them has some strengths and weaknesses, and you should choose such projection that fits best for your needs.
   You can read more about `how to choose a map projection from here <http://www.georeference.org/doc/guide_to_selecting_map_projections.htm>`__,
   and a nice `blog post about the strengths and weaknesses of few commonly used projections <http://usersguidetotheuniverse.com/index.php/2011/03/03/whats-the-best-map-projection/>`__.

Download data
-------------

For this tutorial we will be using a Shapefile representing Europe. Download and extract `Europe_borders.zip <../../_static/data/L2/Europe_borders.zip>`__ file
that contains a Shapefile with following files:

.. code:: bash

   $ cd $HOME
   $ unzip Europe_borders.zip
   $ cd Europe_borders
   $ ls
   Europe_borders.cpg  Europe_borders.prj  Europe_borders.sbx  Europe_borders.shx
   Europe_borders.dbf  Europe_borders.sbn  Europe_borders.shp

Coordinate reference system (CRS)
---------------------------------

GeoDataFrame that is read from a Shapefile contains *always* (well not
always but should) information about the coordinate system in which the
data is projected.

Let's start by reading the data from the ``Europe_borders.shp`` file.

.. ipython:: python

    import geopandas as gpd

    # Filepath to the Europe borders Shapefile
    fp = "/home/geo/Europe_borders.shp"

    @suppress
    import os

    @suppress
    fp = os.path.join(os.path.abspath('data'), "Europe_borders.shp")

    # Read data
    data = gpd.read_file(fp)

We can see the current coordinate reference system from ``.crs``
attribute:

.. ipython:: python

    data.crs

Okey, so from this disctionary we can see that the data is something called
**epsg:4326**. The EPSG number (*"European Petroleum Survey Group"*) is
a code that tells about the coordinate system of the dataset. "`EPSG
Geodetic Parameter Dataset <http://www.epsg.org/>`__ is a collection of
definitions of coordinate reference systems and coordinate
transformations which may be global, regional, national or local in
application". EPSG-number 4326 that we have here belongs to the WGS84
coordinate system (i.e. coordinates are in decimal degrees (lat, lon)).

You can find a lot of information about different available coordinate reference systems from:

  - `www.spatialreference.org <http://spatialreference.org/>`__
  - `www.proj4.org <http://proj4.org/projections/index.html>`__
  - `www.mapref.org <http://mapref.org/CollectionofCRSinEurope.html>`__

Let's also check the values in our ``geometry`` column.

.. ipython:: python

    data['geometry'].head()

Okey, so the coordinate values of the Polygons indeed look like lat-lon values.

Let's convert those geometries into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection (`EPSG: 3035 <http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/etrs89-etrs-laea/>`__).
Changing the projection is really easy to `do in Geopandas <http://geopandas.org/projections.html#re-projecting>`__
with ``.to_crs()`` -function. As an input for the function, you
should define the column containing the geometries, i.e. ``geometry``
in this case, and a ``epgs`` value of the projection that you want to use.

.. ipython:: python

    # Let's take a copy of our layer
    data_proj = data.copy()
    
    # Reproject the geometries by replacing the values with projected ones
    data_proj = data_proj.to_crs(epsg=3035)

Let's see how the coordinates look now.

.. ipython:: python

    data_proj['geometry'].head()

And here we go, the numbers have changed! Now we have successfully
changed the projection of our layer into a new one, i.e. to ETRS-LAEA projection.

.. note::

   There is also possibility to pass the projection information as proj4 strings or dictionaries, see more `here <http://geopandas.org/projections.html#coordinate-reference-systems>`__

To really understand what is going on, it is good to explore our data visually. Hence, let's compare the datasets by making
maps out of them.

.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Plot the WGS84
    data.plot(facecolor='gray');

    # Add title
    plt.title("WGS84 projection");

    # Remove empty white space around the plot
    plt.tight_layout()
    
    # Plot the one with ETRS-LAEA projection
    data_proj.plot(facecolor='blue');

    # Add title
    plt.title("ETRS Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection");

    # Remove empty white space around the plot
    plt.tight_layout()

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt;
       data.plot(facecolor='gray');
       plt.title("WGS84 projection");
       @savefig wgs84.png width=3.5in
       plt.tight_layout();

       data_proj.plot(facecolor="blue");
       plt.title("ETRS Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection");
       @savefig projected.png width=3.5in
       plt.tight_layout();

Indeed, they look quite different and our re-projected one looks much better
in Europe as the areas especially in the north are more realistic and not so stretched as in WGS84.

Next, we still need to change the crs of our GeoDataFrame into EPSG
3035 as now we only modified the values of the ``geometry`` column.
We can take use of fiona's ``from_epsg`` -function.

.. ipython:: python

    from fiona.crs import from_epsg
    
    # Determine the CRS of the GeoDataFrame
    data_proj.crs = from_epsg(3035)
    
    # Let's see what we have
    data_proj.crs

Finally, let's save our projected layer into a Shapefile so that we can use it later.

.. code:: python

    # Ouput file path
    outfp = r"/home/geo/Europe_borders_epsg3035.shp"
    
    # Save to disk
    data_proj.to_file(outfp)

.. note::

   On Windows, the prj -file might NOT update with the new CRS value when using the ``from_epsg()`` -function. If this happens
   it is possible to fix the prj by passing the coordinate reference information as proj4 text, like following.

   .. ipython:: python

      data_proj.crs = '+proj=laea +lat_0=52 +lon_0=10 +x_0=4321000 +y_0=3210000 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs'

   You can find ``proj4`` text versions for different projection from `spatialreference.org <http://spatialreference.org>`__.
   Each page showing spatial reference information has links for different formats for the CRS. Click a link that says ``Proj4`` and
   you will get the correct proj4 text presentation for your projection.

   **Alternative**

   `PyCRS package <https://github.com/karimbahgat/PyCRS>`__ is a handy library for dealing with projections. If you have the package installed (see `installation directions <../../course-info/Installing_Anaconda_GIS.html>`__), you can easily convert crs information between ``EPSG`` and ``ESRI`` codes and ``Proj4`` specification.
   We can pass the Proj4 text into GeoDataFrame as follows:

   .. ipython:: python

      import pycrs
      crs_info = pycrs.parser.from_epsg_code(3035)
      # Now we have a CRS object
      print(crs_info)
      # Convert to Proj4 specification string
      proj4_txt = crs_info.to_proj4()
      print(proj4_txt)
      # Now we have a correct Proj4 text that we can pass to GeoDataFrame
      data_proj.crs = proj4_txt
      # Same thing as a one-liner
      data_proj.crs = pycrs.parser.from_epsg_code(3035).to_proj4()
